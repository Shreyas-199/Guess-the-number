🎯 Number Guessing Game

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my very first Python project – a simple, fun Number Guessing Game. Can you guess the secret number? Let’s find out!

🚀 How It Works

The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.

You try to guess it! 🕵️

If your guess is too low, it says:

“The number is low”

If your guess is too high, it says:

“The number is high”

Keep guessing until you get it right… and then celebrate! 🎉

🎮 How to Play

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Open your terminal and run:

python number_guessing_game.py


Enter your guess and follow the hints.

Keep trying until you guess the number. Can you do it in fewer tries than your friends? 🏆

💡 Features

Gives hints if your guess is too high or too low.

Runs until you guess the correct number.

Fun way to practice Python basics: loops, conditions, and user input.
